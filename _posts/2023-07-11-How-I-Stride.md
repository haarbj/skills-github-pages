# How I Stride

long yet fast

is how I stride.

updown updown updown

is how I stride.

slicing through the air

is how I stride.

arms relaxed, head high

is how I stride.

confident

is how I stride.

eyes on the finish line

is how I stride.

next to my teammates

is how I stride.

with my brothers in battle

is how I stride.

leading the pride

is how I stride.

with a stride as the only thing I do

is how I stride.

obsessed with my stride

is how I stride.

updown up</br></br></br></br>down</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>up down

is how I stride.

wanting my stride to be better than others’

is how I stride.

hating my stride

is how I stride.

accepting my stride for what it is

is how I stride.

accepting others’ strides

is how I stride.

loving others and their strides

is how I stride.
